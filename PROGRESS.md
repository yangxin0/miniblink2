# miniblink-modern — plan & loop state

> A **standalone, single-process embedder of modern Blink (Chromium M150)**: a
> hand-written tiny "content layer" (`miniblink_host`) that boots the real Blink
> engine in-process and renders HTML/CSS/JS to pixels through a pure-C ABI
> (`mb_capi`), with a `wke` compatibility layer and an `mb_shot` CLI on top.
> **No CEF, no browser process, no cross-process Mojo.** Successor to miniblink49
> (which froze at ~M47/2015).
>
> This file is the single source of truth for the loop. Read it, do the next
> **substantive** step, verify it empirically, update this file, commit, repeat.

## ⚠️ Lesson learned (read before acting)
The build-out is **done** (see Current State). Recent work collapsed into
**whack-a-mole**: ~17 of 25 commits were incremental `mb_shot_smoke` / `mb_smoke`
test-padding and micro-flags — manufactured busywork because the core product was
already complete. **Stop that pattern.**

**The rule now:** each tick must move a *substantive* milestone (below) forward, or
fix a *real* bug hit in actual use. **Do NOT** add another test case, micro-flag, or
"characterize + lock in" probe just to have something to commit. If no substantive
step is available and nothing is broken, **say so and stop** — do not invent coverage.

## Active refactor — split the mb_smoke monolith
`test/mb_smoke.cc` is a 3660-line / 180-case monolith. Splitting it into small themed
smoke programs (engine / scrape / input / net / platform), each its own executable.
- [DONE] `test/mb_smoke_harness.h` — shared header-only helpers (`Eval`/`EvalIso`/
  `Expect`/counters) + `MB_SMOKE_MAIN(SUITE)`.
- [DONE] `mb_smoke_platform.cc` (cases 87–106, 43) and `mb_smoke_render.cc` (cases 35–86b
  modern CSS / web components / platform crash-safety / blob / paint / fonts / SVG /
  selector automation / navigation, 77). All three in BUILD.gn + build.sh.
  Now: `mb_smoke` 60 + `mb_smoke_render` 77 + `mb_smoke_platform` 43 = **180**. mb_smoke.cc
  is 3660 -> 1194 lines (engine basics 1–34 + the `MB_NET_TESTS` block + case 107 binding).
- [OPTIONAL] Could peel the `MB_NET_TESTS` block into `mb_smoke_net.cc` to leave mb_smoke.cc
  as pure engine basics — but the 3-way split already addresses the monolith; lower
  priority than the #1 net-interception feature work.

## Current State (complete)
- **Engine:** modern M150 Blink renders HTML→pixels in-process. V8/JS, modern + cutting-edge
  CSS (`:has()`, nesting, `@container`, `oklch()`), canvas 2D, SVG, Web Components/Shadow DOM,
  fetch/XHR (method/body/headers/status/cookies/redirects/charset incl. CJK), blob: URLs,
  Web Crypto, Intersection/Resize/Mutation observers, WAAPI, forms + submit-nav, mouse/keyboard
  input, host-side history, iframes (DOM + paint), CSP-strict pages. Multi-font + i18n render.
- **`mb_capi` C ABI — 108 functions.** lifecycle / load / JS eval / selector scraping /
  input / screenshots (PNG·JPEG·PDF, file + in-memory) / cookies (+ jar) / network config /
  emulation (UA·headers·locale·tz·dark·DPR·transparent·images) / host-side history.
- **`wke` compat layer — 127 functions** (full jsValue object model + async callbacks). Done.
- **`mb_shot` CLI — 59 flags** (request-config → interact → synchronize → prepare-view →
  extract → capture → assert), exit codes 0/1/2/3.
- **Tests (all green, no leaked procs):** `mb_smoke` 179, `wke_smoke` 100, `mb_shot_smoke.sh`
  62 offline (+5 `MB_NET_TESTS=1` = 67). This coverage is **sufficient** — do not pad it.

## Forward plan — grounded in the gap audit (priority order)
The headless render/scrape product is complete; these are the genuine, named gaps that
make this a *real* miniblink. Prioritized by value × tractability × verifiability, and
explicitly avoiding the traps (GPU pipeline; mojo `LocalFrameHost` binding crashes —
a null-remote `WebPolicyContainer` already CHECK-failed). Work top-down; one at a time.

**START HERE — high value, tractable, in code we own, headlessly verifiable:**

1. **Network request/response interception & mocking** — THE signature miniblink feature
   and #1 in the audit. In our libcurl loader (`loader/mb_url_loader.cc`), no mojo.
   - [DONE] **Response mocking** — `mbMockResponse(url_substr, body, content_type, status)`
     + `mbClearMocks()`: a matching URL serves a canned body with NO real fetch (offline
     runs / API substitution). Checked first in `Deliver`. mb_smoke case 75d (mock a
     stylesheet → element turns green; clear/re-mock → red), all offline.
   - [DONE] **URL rewriting** — `mbRewriteUrl(from, to)` + `mbClearUrlRewrites()`:
     transparently redirect a request before fetch (host swap / scheme upgrade / CDN ->
     local mock); the page still sees its original URL as the response URL (Deliver
     fetches `fetch_url`, reports `url`). mb_smoke_render case 75e (rewrite orig.test ->
     mock.test, mocked green; clear -> served by orig's own mock), offline.
   - [DONE] **`mb_shot --mock URL FILE` / `--rewrite FROM TO`** — interception on the
     deliverable CLI: `--mock` serves FILE (content-type by extension) for matching
     requests with no fetch; `--rewrite` redirects before fetch. Verified through the
     fetch() path (mb_shot_smoke: a page fetch()es an API URL served from a local file
     -> GOT:42; a rewrite onto the mock -> GOT:42) — confirms the transparent rewrite
     holds against fetch()'s url_list_ DCHECK.
   - [DONE] **dynamic per-request callback** — `mbSetRequestCallback(cb, userdata)`: a
     process-wide hook consulted in the loader's `Deliver` for EVERY request URL (next to
     the static block/mock/rewrite tables); returns nonzero to BLOCK, zero to allow, so an
     embedder inspects + decides at runtime instead of pre-registering substrings. Loader
     side `MbSetRequestHook`/`MbRequestHookBlocks` (main-thread, inside the load). Verified
     (mb_smoke +1=63, offline): two same-origin fetch()es — the hook records both (seen=2),
     allows the mocked one (ok:7), vetoes the "blockme" one (blocked).
   - [DONE] **response-side callback** — `mbSetResponseCallback(cb, userdata)`: a
     process-wide hook invoked in `Deliver` after a successful load (fetch/mock/file/data)
     with an opaque `mbResponse` handle, BEFORE the body reaches the page. Accessors
     `mbResponseURL/Status/Body` (inspect) + `mbResponseSetBody` (replace — inject a
     script, strip content, rewrite a payload; the new length is delivered). Loader side
     `MbSetResponseHook`/`MbInvokeResponseHook` (std::function so the capi binds a lambda).
     Verified (mb_smoke +1=64, offline): a mock serves {"v":1}; the hook records it and
     rewrites to {"v":99}; the page's fetch() observes v=99.
   - [DONE] **per-URL request header injection** — `mbSetRequestHeader(url_substring, name,
     value)` + `mbClearRequestHeaders()`: add an outgoing http(s) header for requests whose
     URL contains the substring (e.g. an Authorization/API key sent ONLY to its host, not
     leaked to every origin; or a per-domain UA) — conditional on the URL, unlike global
     extra-headers. Applied in `FetchHttp` (the shared http chokepoint), so it covers BOTH
     the top-level navigation (MbFetchUrl) and subresources/fetch (Deliver). Verified
     (mb_smoke 32b, MB_NET_TESTS vs httpbin /headers): the header registered for "/headers"
     is echoed; one for a non-matching host is not.
   - [NEXT] wke peers — wire the host hooks into the wke layer (`wkeOnLoadUrlBegin` onto the
     request hook, `wkeNetOnResponse` onto the response hook). Friction: wke's job-based API
     + per-view vs our process-wide hooks; needs a pragmatic mapping.

   **→ Network interception (#1) is now comprehensive: static block/mock/URL-rewrite +
   per-URL header inject + dynamic request hook + response hook + CLI (--mock/--rewrite).**

2. **Quick-win correctness bugs** (real defects; fast; each independently verifiable —
   NOTE several have *existing tests that assert the stubbed/fake behavior* and must be
   updated):
   - [DONE] `wkeIsLoadingCompleted`/`wkeIsDocumentReady` were hardcoded `true` → wired to
     real state. `wkeIsLoadingCompleted` returns a new `did_load` flag (set on every load
     path via FireLoadCallbacks) — false on a fresh view, distinguishing "never navigated"
     from "loaded". `wkeIsDocumentReady` evals the real `document.readyState`
     (interactive|complete) — false if no frame / still parsing. `wkeIsLoading` stays
     `false` (correct: the synchronous load model never exposes an in-flight window;
     comment clarified). Verified (wke_smoke +1=102): fresh view → not completed; post-load
     → completed + ready.
   - [DONE] `wkePostURL` ignored `postLen` → truncated binary bodies at an embedded NUL.
     Fixed by threading the byte length end-to-end: new `mbPostURLData(url, body, len, ct)`
     (mbPostURL kept as the NUL-terminated text convenience), `MbWebView::PostURL` builds
     the body from (ptr, len), and `wkePostURL` passes `postLen`. The libcurl loader already
     used `POSTFIELDSIZE`/`COPYPOSTFIELDS(.size())`, so binary bodies now post whole.
     Verified (wke_smoke +1 net): POST "AB\0CD" (5 bytes) → httpbin echoes Content-Length 5
     (pre-fix would truncate to "AB" = 2).
   - [DONE] `wkeFireKeyUpEvent` was a no-op → now dispatches a real key RELEASE so page
     `keyup` handlers fire. New `MbWidget::SendKeyUp(vk)` emits a single kKeyUp
     WebKeyboardEvent (dom_key from the shared `kKeys` table for named keys, else the
     unshifted ASCII char; keyCode from the VK), exposed as `mbSendKeyUp(view, vk)`;
     `wkeFireKeyUpEvent` calls it. Press events untouched (no decouple → no regression
     to the Enter-submit path). Verified (wke_smoke +1): VK_RIGHT keyup → page sees
     keyCode 39. (Refactored `kKeys` to file scope; SendKey behavior unchanged, 182 green.)
   - [DONE] `mbShutdown` re-init leak/crash. It did `delete g_runtime`, leaving the
     installed `DiscardableMemoryAllocator`/blink `Platform` pointers dangling and
     making a 2nd `mbInitialize` re-run the one-time globals (mojo::core::Init,
     blink::Initialize + isolate) → crash. Fixed to match Chromium's process model: the
     engine is one-time and stays resident; `mbShutdown` is a safe no-op and
     `mbInitialize` is idempotent (reuses it). Verified (mb_smoke 0 +1=61): shutdown ->
     re-init succeeds AND all 60 subsequent tests run against the post-cycle engine.
   - [DONE] Deleted the dead `widget/mb_sw_frame_sink.{h,cc}` scaffolding (an empty
     `MbSoftwareFrameSink` stub never referenced — the real readback is paint-record
     playback in mb_widget.cc) + its BUILD.gn entries. Builds clean, mb_smoke 61.

   **→ Quick-win cluster (item 2) COMPLETE — all five defects fixed & verified.**

**Tier 1 — genuine high-value automation capability (after the above):**
3. **Iframe / sub-frame targeting** (audit #2).
   - [DONE] **per-frame eval** — `mbGetFrameCount()` + `mbEvalJSInFrame(frame_index, js)`:
     evals host-privileged in the Nth child frame's own world, so it reads even a
     CROSS-ORIGIN iframe the parent's `iframe.contentDocument` can't (single-process =
     all iframes are local `WebLocalFrame`s). mb_smoke_render 78b: data: iframe under an
     https parent -> parent read NULLDOC, `mbEvalJSInFrame(0,...)` reads XFRAME-SECRET.
   - [DONE] **`mb_shot --frame N`** — routes `--eval`/`--eval-json` into child frame N
     (host-privileged), so the CLI scrapes iframe content the page can't. mb_shot_smoke:
     parent body=`parent`, `--frame 0 --eval document.body.textContent`=`CHILD-77`.
   - [NEXT] per-frame selector ops (click/fill/text-by-selector in a frame) via the same
     child-frame mechanism + a wke `wkeRunJsByFrame` peer.
4. **Push callback model** — replace poll-only readiness with real engine signals.
   - [DONE] **load-finished push** — `MbFrameClient::DidFinishLoad()` (main frame) →
     `MbWebView::OnDidFinishLoad()` sets a `load_finished_` flag (reset in CommitHtml on
     every navigation) + invokes a registered callback. C ABI: `mbOnLoadFinish(view, cb,
     userdata)` (the first push callback in mb_capi — fires during the synchronous load
     pump on the genuine `load` event, not a poll/timer) + `mbIsLoadFinished(view)`.
     Verified (mb_smoke +1=62): a counting callback fires once per load (fin=2 over 2
     loads), flag set. This is the signal that lets a caller wait on real completion
     rather than a fixed settle — addresses the partial-capture race.
   - [DONE] **navigation policy** — `mbOnNavigation(view, cb, userdata)`: the callback fires
     for each PAGE-initiated main-frame navigation (link/location=/form/JS-redirect) with the
     target URL, BEFORE commit, in `MbFrameClient::BeginNavigation`; returns 1=allow / 0=block
     (stop popups/redirects/leaving the page) — host-driven LoadURL bypasses it. Also made
     `DoCommit` honor mocks so a page navigation is served from the interception layer too.
     Verified (mb_smoke 0g, offline): a callback lets nav.test/ok commit (mock → GOOD) and
     vetoes nav.test/blocked (stays GOOD); the log shows both URLs.
   - [DONE] **new-window notification** — `mbOnNewWindow(view, cb, userdata)`: fires when the
     page calls `window.open()` / activates `target=_blank`, with the requested URL + window
     name, via `MbFrameClient::CreateNewWindow` (which still returns null = popup denied, the
     safe default). The embedder can react (e.g. load the URL in this/a new view). Verified
     (mb_smoke 0h, offline): `window.open('https://popup.test/p','winname')` → callback logs
     `popup.test/p|winname` and window.open returns null.
   - [NEXT] `DidFailLoad` failed-flag on the load-finish signal, and wiring the load
     primitives to wait on `load_finished()` instead of a fixed mbWait.

   **→ Tier-1 push-callback model (#4) is now functionally complete: load-finish push,
   navigation policy, AND new-window notification.**
5. **JS dialogs** — [DONE]. `mbSetJsDialogCallback(view, cb, userdata)`: the callback is
   invoked per dialog (type 0/1/2 = alert/confirm/prompt) with the message + prompt default;
   returns accept(1)/dismiss(0) and writes prompt text. No callback → headless-safe defaults
   (confirm=false, prompt=null). **Sidesteps the earlier landmine entirely**: instead of
   re-entering ChromeClient's `[Sync]` RunModal*Dialog (which deadlocks / the reverted
   `mbSetJsDialogPolicy` FATAL'd in `thread_collision_warner` via `ScopedPagePauser`), it
   installs a pure JS-level override of window.alert/confirm/prompt before page scripts
   (in RunDocumentStartScript) that routes to an internal `__mbDlg` native binding → the
   view's handler — synchronous, main-thread, no browser/modal/mojo. Verified (mb_smoke 0f):
   callback captures "0:hi;1:go?;2:name?;", confirm→true, prompt→"REPLY"; no-callback →
   confirm=false, prompt=null.
6. **File upload + download** — [DONE] (both).
   - [DONE] **`mbDownloadURL(url, dest_path)`**: fetch a URL through the engine network stack
     (MbFetchUrl) and write the body to disk WITHOUT rendering it as a document. Honors the
     full interception layer (rewrite / block / mock / request+response hooks) and, for
     http(s), the view's UA + extra/per-URL headers + cookies + proxy. Works for http(s),
     file:// and data:. Verified (mb_smoke 0e, offline): a data: URL decodes to the file
     (DL-DATA-7); a mocked URL downloads with NO network and the response hook rewrites the
     bytes (REWRITTEN). (Browser-style "navigation that turns into a download" — detecting
     Content-Disposition mid-commit — is NOT done; this is the explicit host-driven form.)
   - [DONE] **`mbSetFileForSelector(css_selector, paths_newline)`**: the privileged host op a
     page's own script is forbidden to do. Reaches the core `HTMLInputElement`, reads each
     path's bytes into an **in-memory `BlobData` registered with our BlobRegistry** (via
     `BlobDataHandle::Create(BlobData, size)` — the SAME path `new Blob([bytes])` takes, so
     the bytes are genuinely readable), builds a `FileList` of `File(name, time, handle)`,
     `setFiles()` (which stores the list verbatim — no re-wrap), then fires `change`. Verified
     (mb_smoke_render 62-file): set a 17-byte file → `files[0].name`=mb_upload.txt, `.size`=17,
     **FileReader reads the real bytes** "UPLOAD-CONTENT-42" (the form-submit byte path),
     change fires once; a text input and a non-match return 0.
     NOTE: the earlier dead-end was a manual MbBlob+PostTask handle (size 0 / read hung); the
     `BlobData`+registry path is what actually works. `SetFilesFromPaths` (path-backed) does
     NOT work here — no file-reading blob backend — which is why we read the bytes ourselves.

**Tier 2 — web-platform fidelity (host infra; heavier):**
7. Workers (dedicated worker thread+isolate; shared/service absent). 8. Broker binds cookies
only — IndexedDB / WebSocket / Permissions / geolocation / clipboard / notifications dropped.
9. Storage/cookie persistence across runs + async CookieStore + change events. 10. Blob-from-file
+ ranged blob reads + DataPipeGetter uploads. 11. **GPU content path** (WebGL / accel-2d-canvas /
`<video>` render blank) — the heaviest; needs a GL/media provider. Last.

**Tier 3 — input & rendering refinements:**
12. Input fidelity (modifier flags, right/middle-click, IME, native drag-drop, trusted touch/wheel).
13. PDF options (page size / landscape / margins / scale / print-background — currently hardcoded
US-Letter). 14. Child-frame charset hardcoded UTF-8 → mojibake on non-UTF-8 iframes
(`mb_frame_client.cc:182`). 15. CSP/PolicyContainer leaks across navigations in a reused view.

### Accepted, by-design (NOT tasks):
- `<meta name=viewport>` ignored (mobile = narrow view + UA, works). Color emoji monochrome
  (no color-emoji font bundled).
